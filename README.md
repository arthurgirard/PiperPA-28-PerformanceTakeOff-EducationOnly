This project provides a Python-based tool to estimate the takeoff performance of a PA-28-181 aircraft based on digitized data from the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).

🛑 *** CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING *** 🛑

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR FLIGHT PLANNING OR REAL-WORLD AVIATION DECISIONS.

This software is provided for educational and informational purposes ONLY. It is a programming exercise and an interpretation of the aircraft's performance charts. It has not been certified, tested, or validated by any aviation authority (FAA, EASA, etc.) or by the aircraft manufacturer.

Disclaimer of Liability

The author(s) and contributor(s) of this software provide it "AS IS" and without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. By using this software, you agree that the author(s) and contributor(s) shall not be held liable for any damages, incidents, accidents, or losses of any kind (including, but not limited to, personal injury, death, or property damage) resulting directly or indirectly from its use.

You, the user, assume ALL RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY for any use of this software or its outputs.

Purpose

The sole purpose of this tool is to demonstrate:

How performance data can be digitized from a POH.

How interpolation can be used to estimate values between charted points.

The creation of a user interface (using Gradio) for a technical model.

✅ FOR ACTUAL FLIGHT PLANNING ✅

ALWAYS AND ONLY refer to the official, up-to-date Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) / Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) for your specific aircraft serial number.

You must perform all flight planning and performance calculations manually using the approved POH/AFM as required by aviation regulations and safe operating practices. Relying on uncertified, non-official tools like this one for flight decisions is dangerous, contrary to regulations, and strictly prohibited.
